## I'm a lifetime student of everything that is interesting, a developer and passionate problemsolver!

- 💪 I'm into application development and do not discriminate on platform: mobile / web / desktop / ...
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ... well, everything:

  - Java
  - Spring
  - Vanilla JS
  - Node JS
  - Angular / React / Vue
  - Kotlin
  - Swift
  - C#
  - C++ (Just to see where we came from though. I might spend some more time on this,
          if I feel the need or want to get nostalgic. 🤣)
  
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate with other developers
- 🥅 2020 Goals: Contribute more to Open Source projects
- ⚡ Fun fact: I love to draw ✏️, make delicious food 🍴 and be around water ( swimming 🏊 / sailing ⛵ / ... )
